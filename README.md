# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
## Description:
### tracks the bus stops from MIT to Havard using designated long/lat coordinates. Maps were populated by mapbox, as well as css and other files.
## Future Roadmap:
### I have a lot of plans on how to improve this project. One facet of that is to map out every gas station from Lehi, Utah, to Seattle, Washington. I would also like to adapt this project to play around with various map types and interactive features.
